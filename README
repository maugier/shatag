  
  Shatag is a collection of tools to store sha256 checksums of files in their Extended
Attributes.

  Shatag is currently written for Python 3, and requires the pyxattr
(http://pyxattr.sourceforge.net) and argparse (http://code.google.com/p/argparse/) packages.

  Before you attempt to use it, make sure the filesystem you will be working on has
support for user extended attributes (Typically requiring to enable the user_xattr mount option).

Summary of tools:

* shatag [-t|-u] [-fqvr0] FILES...
  
  With no arguments, display the stored checksums with the same format as the sha256sum(1) tool.
Files that have no checksum, or whose checksum is older than the file modification time, will not be displayed.

Mode selection flags:

   -t,--tag: compute and display a checksum for all specified files.Checksums whose timestamp
       match the modification time of the file will not be recomputed.

   -u,--update: compute, store and display the checksum for files that have an existing outdated checksum.

   Otherwise: just display known and fresh checksums.

Options:

   -f,--force: when using --tag or --update, ignore the checksum timestamp (all checksums are
       considered outdated)

   -q,--quiet: do not output the valid checksums on stdout

   -v,--verbose: print information about missing or outdated checksums on stderr.

   -r,--recursive: recurse trough directories

   -0,--print0: when printing checksums, use NUL as record separator, instead of LF. 

If -t or -u are used, giving file names is mandatory. Otherwise, if no files are given,
it applies to all non-hidden files of the current directory.

* shatag-mkdb [-v] [-d DATABASE] [-n NAME] HOST PATH

  Collects tags from a given path on a remote host, inserting them in a database for fast
local lookup

  -n,--name NAME:  location name, that will be used by the lookup tools. Defaults to the hostname.
  
  -d,--database FILE: path to sqlite database (defaults to $HOME/.shatagdb)

* shatagq [-C] [-d DATABASE] {-n NAME} FILES...

  Examine local checkums, and compare against a database of remote files
  
  -C,--nocolor: disable color output
  -d,--database: database file (defaults to $HOME/.shatagdb)
  -n,--name: names to include in comparison (defaults to all)

TODO: 
  * something that sorts the output of findshatag(1) to find duplicates
  * something that fetches the tags and stores it in sqlite for remote usage
  * something to manage collections of sqlite databases and efficiently lookup local checksums
     against it.
