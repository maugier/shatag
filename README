Shatag is a collection of tools to store sha256 checksums of files in their Extended
Attributes.

Before you attempt to use it, make sure the filesystem you will be working on has
support for user extended attributes (Typically requiring to enable the user_xattr mount option).

Summary of tools:

* shatag [-t|-u] [-fvq] FILES...
  
  With no arguments, display the stored checksums with the same format as the sha256sum(1) tool.
Files that have no checksum, or whose checksum is older than the file modification time, will not be displayed.

   -t,--tag: compute and display a checksum for all specified files.Checksums whose timestamp
       match the modification time of the file will not be recomputed.

   -u,--update: like --tag, but ignore files without a checksum, only update the outdated ones.

   -f,--force: when using --tag or --update, ignore the checksum timestamp (all checksums are
       considered outdated)

   -q,--quiet: do not output the valid checksums on stdout

   -v,--verbose: print information about missing or outdated checksums on stderr.


* findshatag [FINDSPEC]

 Trivial wrapper for find(1) that outputs the hashes


TODO: 
  * something that sorts the output of findshatag(1) to find duplicates
  * something that fetches the tags and stores it in sqlite for remote usage
  * something to manage collections of sqlite databases and efficiently lookup local checksums
     against it.
